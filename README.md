# Welcome!

This is a tutorial covering factor variables and summary statistics in R. We will be using an RMarkdown file for this course, which you can access using this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NUpolisci/IntermedTidyFactor/main/Factor_variables.Rmd). To get started, please download the file and open it using RStudio. 


All you need for the tutorial is the above markdown file. We will be using data from the [2019 British election study.](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/2019-british-election-study-post-election-random-probability-survey/)
